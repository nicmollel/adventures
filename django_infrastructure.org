* On Web Development
** All Other Thoughts
   - Support *OAuth* with *OpenID*, *Google*, *Yahoo*
     + *Facebook* will be left out here because the target market. This
       might change if there appear to be a demand
   - Before I even got anything off the ground, I had to spend time
     and wrap my head around /ssh_config/ so that I can manage the
     different keys that I use for github. I finally learned the
     difference between *Host* and *Hostname* and how to use them
     correctly in conjunction.

** Getting Everyone to Play Nice Together
*** Nginx and Django
    - First make sure everything is uptodate. Also update *pip* to be
      sure the version in use is the latest.

      This is how to update *pip*
      #+BEGIN_CODE
      pip install --upgrade [packagename]
      #+END_CODE
      /packagename/ can be *pip* for a self update. 
    - another good option to know for *pip* is /--outdated/ 
    - FastCGI, i think I got it set up but now I need to wrap my head
      around *Nginx* configurations. I guess what I would like to know
      if I can have different instances of django or other services
      such as *hunchentoot* to run on the same server at the same time
      and server different applications. 
    - I used *Django* documentations to get this done.
